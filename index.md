I am a 1st year Ms/PhD student at the College of Information and Computer Sciences, University of Massachusetts Amherst.

I am interested in Machine Learning Theory, Multi-Armed Bandits, Reinforcement Learning, Non Convex Optimization and Randomized algorithms. I use techniques from Probability, Statistics and Linear Algebra to design and analyse algorithms with provable guarentees for these areas.

I was a Budding Scientist at [Conduent Labs](http://indialabs.conduent.com/)/Xerox Research Center India from 2016 to 2017. I graduted from the [Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur](https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/) with a Bachelor's degree in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/) in 2016.
You can find my CV here :[CV](https://sudeepraja.github.io/CV.pdf)

I also write a blog about some of the things I encounter during my research.
