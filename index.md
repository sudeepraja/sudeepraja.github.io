I am a 1st year Ms/PhD student at the College of Information and Computer Sciences, University of Massachusetts Amherst.

I am interested in Machine Learning Theory, Multi-Armed Bandits, Online Learning, Reinforcement Learning Theory, Non Convex Optimization and Randomized algorithms.

I also write a blog about some of the things I encounter during my research.

I was a Budding Scientist at [Conduent Labs](http://indialabs.conduent.com/)/Xerox Research Center India from June 2016 to June 2017. I graduted from the [Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur](https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/) with a Bachelor's degree in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/) in 2016. 

My CV: [CV](https://sudeepraja.github.io/CV.pdf)
