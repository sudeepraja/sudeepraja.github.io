I am a 1st year PhD student at the College of Information and Computer Sciences, University of Massachusetts Amherst.

I am interested in Machine Learning Theory, Multi-Armed Bandits, Online Learning, Reinforcement Learning Theory and Convex/Non-Convex/Combinatorial Optimization.

I was a Budding Scientist at Conduent Labs/Xerox Research Center India from June 2016 to June 2017. I graduted from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering in 2016.
