I am a first year Ms/PhD student at the [College of Information and Computer Sciences](https://www.cics.umass.edu/) at the [University of Massachusetts Amherst](http://www.umass.edu/).

I am broadly interested in the theoretical foundations of Machine Learning. Some speicific areas of interest include Online Learning, Bandits, Statistical Learning Theory, Reinforcement Learning Theory and Convex/Non-Convex/Combinatorial Optimization.

Prior to joining UMass, I was a Budding Scientist at Conduent Labs/Xerox Research Center India from June 2016 to June 2017. I graduted from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering in 2016.
