I am a first year doctoral student in the Industrial Engineering and Operations Research Department at Columbia University.

I am broadly interested in the theoretical aspects of Machine Learning. Some speicific areas of interest include Online Learning, Bandits, Optimization, Reinforcement Learning Theory and Statistical learning theory.

I hold an MS in CS from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst and a B.Tech in CSE from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. I spent a year as a Budding Scientist at Conduent Labs/Xerox Research Center India.

> Don't worry about the overall importance of the problem; work on it if it looks interesting. I think there's a sufficient correlation between interest and importance. â€” David Blackwell
