I will be joining the PhD program in the Industrial Engineering and Operations Research Department at Columbia University, starting Fall 2019.

I am broadly interested in the theoretical acpects of Machine Learning. Some speicific areas of interest include Online Learning, Bandits, Statistical Learning Theory, Reinforcement Learning Theory and Optimization.

I hold an MS in CS from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst and a B.Tech in CSE from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. I spent a year as a Budding Scientist at Conduent Labs/Xerox Research Center India.
